JEET.Lab1 - JavaSE GUI & Database Management
This project was developed based on the "Lab.1: Building a JavaSE application with GUI for database management using H2DB, Maven, JUnit and Git in NetBeans IDE" student guide prepared by Łukasz Laszko. The primary goal of the project is to experience a professional software development lifecycle, including Java SE, Maven, H2DB, and JUnit integration.

🎓 Academic Scope
This laboratory work focuses on the following core competencies:


Development Environment: Configuring Java 17 (LTS) within the NetBeans IDE.


Database Integration: Managing database operations using H2DB in "Embedded" mode.


Data Access: Handling CRUD operations through the UserDAO class.


Test-Driven Development: Verifying the DAO layer using JUnit 5.

🛠 Technical Architecture

Maven: Dependency management via pom.xml.


H2 Database: Automated table creation during application startup using DatabaseInitializer.


Swing GUI: Providing a visual user interface through the UserApp class.


Git: Managing the project lifecycle with add, commit, and push operations.

🚀 Execution Instructions

Database Initialization: The DatabaseInitializer.initialize() method is automatically called when the project's main class is executed.


Adding Users: Name and email information can be saved via the form on the GUI.


Running Tests: Unit tests can be executed through the UserDAOTest class.
